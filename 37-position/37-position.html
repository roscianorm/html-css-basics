						BMO (abbreviated from "Be MOre," phonetically spelled "Beemo", also
						referred to as Moe Mastro "Llabtoof" Giovanni Jr. and called the
						"New King of Ooo" in the future) is one of the main characters of
						Adventure Time and also the titular main protagonist of the Distant
						Lands episode of the same name. BMO is Finn and Jake's living video
						game console system, portable electrical outlet, computer, music
						player, VCR, video player, video editor, roommate, camera, alarm
						clock, toaster, flashlight, strobe light, skateboarder, soccer
						player, tape player, chef, detective, and friend. They make their
						appearance in the title scene of the Theme Song of every episode of
						Adventure Time, just as Finn and Jake pound their fists together.
						BMO is characterized as a loyal, trusting and helpful robot who is
						protective of Finn and Jake.
